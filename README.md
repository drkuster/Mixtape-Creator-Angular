## Description

In the name of good karma, I've decided to apply what I know about Angular thus far to make YOU a mixtape! That's right, you! Don't get too excited though: it's just text on a screen. I'm just here to help you organize your thoughts. Mixtape Creator was made using Angular 10 after completing roughly 20% of Maximillian Schwarzmuller's The Complete Angular Guide course. The mini-site uses multiple components in communication with each other, data binding galore and just a pinch of ingenuity. Enjoy!
